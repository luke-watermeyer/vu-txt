The idea behind the chunking is supposed to be very flexible.

The immediately obvious use case would be to, for example, chunk content using a chunkChar of \n, \r\n, <hr /> or some similar delimiter

Using it this way will allow you to easily chunk any random text that is input in a way that is visually appealing without actually knowing what the text is

But you could also use it with your OWN DEFINED chunkChars, meaning you could essentially use it as your own formatting.
